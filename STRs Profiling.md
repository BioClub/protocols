# STRs Profiling

"Profile" a person using STR sites. Gene sites and primer sequences are listed [here](https://strbase.nist.gov/fbicore.htm)

## Equipment needed

- Pipettes
- 0.2ml PCR Tubes
- Thermalcycler (PCR Machine)
- Electrophoresis system
- Transilluminator (Blue LED)
- Gel Cast and Combs
- Microwave
- Precise Scale (0.01g)
- 200ml Erlenmeyer Flask (the triangle one)
- Saranwrap

## Reagents needed
- Template DNA
- Primers
- Taq DNA Polymerase (+dNTPs and +MgCl2) (50ul Reaction Mix)
- DNase/Nuclase Free Water (autoclaved 18mohm water is fine)
- Nippon Gene Agarose 21
- 0.5x TAE Buffer
- DNA Loading buffer
- Nippon Genetics Midori Green XTRA
- DNA Ladder (100bp-2000bp)

**You also need TE buffer if your primer was sent in powder form** 

## Steps
**The amounts used in this protocol is based on a 50ul PCR Reaction**

1. Mix Taq DNA Polymerase as directed. Keep in mind you generally don't want to freeze and thaw a lot, so make 8x stocks.
2. Load 20ul of template DNA, and also load forward and reverse primers (If the stock is 100uM(100pmol/ul), load 0.1ul).
3. Add 20ul Water so the final volume of each tube is 50ul
4. Run the thermalcycler with the following steps: 1x `95C 30sec` 35x `95C 30sec - 45C 60sec - 68C 60sec` 1x `68C 300sec`
4.5. Take a break
5. Put 30ml of 0.5x TAE buffer, and 0.6g of Agarose 21 into a Erlenmeyer Flask and close it with a piece of Saranwrap
6. Microwave the solution and mix every 10 seconds or so, so that the gel does'nt blow over. (And take care not to burn yourself)
7. After the gel "boils" about 3 times, take the flask out of the microwave with a mit.
8. When the gel cools down to about 60-50C, add 2ul of Midori Green XTRA and mix well.
9. Pour gel into cast and place the 9well comb inside. Pipette out any bubbles at this point.
10. When the gel is fully cast, take out the comb and place gel in electrophoresis system. Make sure you put the well side on the negative charged side.
11. Pour 0.5x TAE into electrophoresis bath.
12. When the PCR is done, add 5ul Loading Buffer to each tube and pipette well.
13. Load 5ul DNA Ladder and samples into each well and start the current. Patterns should be visible in about 30 mins.
