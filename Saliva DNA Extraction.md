```diff
- Needs tweaking
```

Extract DNA from saliva, without expensive reagents. Based off [eMyco Mycoplasma PCR Detection kit's protocol](https://intronbio.com:6001/intronbioen_m/product/product_view.php?PRDT_ID=125#none)

## Equipment needed

- MiniPCR or any other heatblock  
- Micro Pipettes  
- 1.5ml Tubes  
- Chibitan (1.5ml Mini Centrifuge)
- 0.2ml PCR Tubes

## Reagents needed

- PBS(-) or D-PBS(-)
- Sample Saliva (about 5ml)


## Steps

1. Prepare 2 tubes with 1ml of sample saliva
2. Spin tubes in a centrifuge for about 5 minutes and decant supernatant wihtout breaking the pellet formed on the bottom of the tube.
3. Suspend the pellet with 1ml PBS and spin for 5 minutes. Decant supernatant wihtout breaking the pellet formed on the bottom of the tube.
4. Repeat step 3
5. Resuspend pellet in 100uL PBS and transfer to 0.2ml PCR tubes
6. Heat samples to 95C for 15 minutes
7. Pipette samples thoroughly and transfer to clean 1.5ml tube
8. Spin samples down for 10 mins and collect the supernatant  
9. Use supernatant
